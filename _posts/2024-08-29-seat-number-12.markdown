I stared up at the ceiling fan, unable to fall asleep. I had an unintended roommate that evening in the form of a gecko. He wasn't my primary concern, nor was the heat. A much simpler problem occupied my mind: what time should I set my alarm for in the morning? 

I was in Bagan, the land of a thousand pagodas. The sunrise view is meant to be incredible.

That sounded nice. On the other hand, I always prioritize a good night's sleep. And there were many logistics involved. And I am naturally kind of lazy, and... and...

As the list of pros and cons ballooned in my head, I came up with one item on the "pro" side that felt decisive: my bus seat number. I had seat number 12 on the bus. Pretty much every possible configuration I could think of involved seat number 12 being a window. I am well practiced with sleeping against a window, so that settled it. I decided I could sleep on the bus and I set my alarm.

A few hours later, I hopped on a bicycle and sweated my way through the early morning and up a hill to a viewing area. I got there a few minutes early, with the sun just starting to peek out. As the sun rose, so did the hot air balloons. First just black shadows in the sky and then as colored groups, each fleet visually distinct in color. My eyes satisfied by the slow march of rainbow over the softly lit stone. It was a beautiful scene. I felt I had made the right decision.

To my planning mind, equally satisfying was what followed. I biked back, grabbed breakfast, and boarded the bus with time to spare. I smiled as I boarded, seeing two seats per row, the first row starting with 1. No shenanigans, a standard bus configuration. The first one outlined above. My calculation had come to fruition.

I approached my row, with confidence that seat number 12 would be a window â€“ and it was. All my planning hadn't factored in one crucial detail. Seat number 12 was not just occupied, it was fully taken over. A blanket draped carefully, toys all around, and snacks tucked into the seat pocket. A young mother sat there with her baby. I smiled at them and without hesitating I settled into seat 11.

One of the potentially radical teachings in Buddhism is on the sense doors. Normally, it's thought that humans have five
senses: touch, sight, sound, taste, smell. The sixth sense in the Buddha's teaching is "thinking".

Thoughts can feel much more important than our other senses. Particularly because they often occur in response to them. We can see a bear on TV and we can see a bear a few feet from us in the wild. Both are "seeing", they will prompt very different "feelings"^1 . 

So this isn't to say that thoughts are not valuable. But as a matter of first hand experience thoughts are just another arising in the mind. Meditation can help us see this clearly. 

As a matter of first hand experience this is true: thoughts are just another arising of the mind. This is not to
discount their power or potential value.

It also does mean we can have some wisdom about whether or not to take them seriously. In terms of my thoughts, planning
is chief among them. My long term planning isn't great, but my mind gets pleasure in a plan coming together. On a
recent drive to LA, I had chosen what felt like the optimal gas station to stop at. The exact moment I was exiting the freeway, my gas light went on. What a joy!

One thing the practice of meditation has helped me with is understanding that reality is not. And to
hold thoughts and plans loosely. Expectations not meeting reality being a primary source of suffering.

A helpful teaching from one of my teachers is to really discount the thoughts that occur while laying in bed at night
trying to fall asleep. It's rare for anything useful to arise in these moments, and most likely they will arise again if
they are truly wise.

^1 This is also an important note about the senses, we often think of touch sense as something we are doing when this sense encapsulates all bodily sensations.
