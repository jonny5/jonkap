In the age of the internet and social media, the way to get engagement is to put someone or something else down in order to get noticed. This isn't required but is a natural incentive structure built out of what evokes the strongest emotion.

Music is an area I see where this isn't the case. It can evoke all kinds of emotions, enhance or counterract what is already present. And sharing it with others and bonding over it can be powerful.

In the area of memes, musical ones can be quite wholesome. Autotune brought this out initially, taking existing memes and turning them into a songs (notably by Schomoyo): 

I was reminded of this format when coming across this more recent one.

Sampling as a concept is profound in this way. In doing lots of meditation I have heard lots of dharma talks* and a common refrain from the teacher will be something like: "Take what's useful and let the rest slip away". A musician sampling another doing something similar taking what they find the most evocative from a song and stripping the rest away.
