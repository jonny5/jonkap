This blog exists firstly to organize my thoughts and get them out of the head. That's for me. For you, the intention is
to share stories that can point to a way of living that is more conducive to contentment. Hopefully it will be
entertaining too, although that remains to be seen.

I will structure some posts as a story followed by some basic teachings that relate to it. Other posts might just be
silly (like my homepage). If you'd like direct meditation related content there are lots of resources from more
qualified sources that I'd be happy to share with you. So reach out if that interests you.
