This blog exists firstly to organize my thoughts and get them out of the head. That's for me. For you, dear reader, my
intention is to share stories that can point to a way of living that is more conducive to contentment. My main desire is
to convey the value I have found in meditation and the principles and teachings around it in an indirect way. If you'd
like direct meditation related content there are lots of good resources that I'd be happy to discuss with you. Hopefully
I can provide some entertainment as well, although that remains to be seen.

Everyone has their own unique path in this life and I don't expect yours to resemble mine. With that said, if you are
curious about what got me started on this path, here's a rough timeline:

December 2016: I quit my job at a protypical SF startup. My brother Benjy was having a major surgery and I wanted to be
able to spend time and support him. Admittedly the decision was simplified by the company not living up to the hype (it
was protypical in this way, too). I had no immediate plans other than supporting him. So this left me with plenty of
time. Much of it was spent idling away, watching shows, reading, and listening to podcasts.

January 2017: One of the podcasts I regularly listened to was Waking Up with Sam Harris. He released an episode with
Joseph Goldstein called <a href="https://samharris.org/episode/SE4C737F8F2">Why Meditate?</a>. A few parts of the
conversation really resonated with me. Shortly after, I started a meditation practice using the 10% Happier App where
Joseph Goldstein does the intro course. I pretty quickly took to the practice, finding real value in the space that can
open between thought and action and seeing the patterns of my own mind.

April 2017: Benjy's surgery that removed a kidney, his gallbladder and part of his intenstines, did not successfully
remove it's intended target: the cancer in his stomach. The diagnosis was grim. I knew I wanted to be able to support
him as best I could. My intentions were clear and yet I saw my ego, my emotional barriers, and neuroses as blocking
myself from being fully present. Meditation practice increased my capacity for support.

August 2017: A discussion point on that podcast episode is the encouragement of doing an intro meditation retreat. This
is a time where one joins a group all sitting and practicing together in silence for about a week. I signed up for one
in August of that year, a young adult retreat at Spirit Rock. I found the experience transformative, heart-opening, and
it gave me a new and kinder access to the landscape of my own mind.

October-December 2017: Benjy's body slowly and then quickly lost all of it's strength. I felt like I could be there with
him with more presence and love up until his last breath thanks to my continued practice. I intend to write more about
him in the future (
<a href="/benjy-celebration-of-life-speech.html">here is my speech from his celebration of life</a>
).

The tragedy really clarified some things for me, around the fragility of life and finding contentment that is not bound
to conditions. Since then I have continued finding value and meaning in the practice. I am involved with a community in
the Bay Area: IMC and IRC, have spent many months on meditation retreats and practiced in India and Burma.

I have continued to find more value in the practice, in finding the capacities and limitations of my own emotional and
mental landscape. This is what I hope to share some of on this blog.
