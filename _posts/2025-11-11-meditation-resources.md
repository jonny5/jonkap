Here are a bunch of resources 🙂

Local groups/teachers I like:
- https://www.bigheartcity.org/ in SF, main teacher is Vinny Ferraro
- https://sundaysangha.net/ in Berkeley w/ Will Kabat Zinn
- https://www.insightmeditationcenter.org/ in Redwood City, I like Nikki Mirghafori and Gil Fronsdal
- SF Dharma Collective - have been thinking of going on a monday

Retreat centers:
- Spirit Rock
- IRC ( https://www.insightretreatcenter.org/ in Santa Cruz affiliated with Redwood city center).

Online talks:
Main sites are https://dharmaseed.org/ and https://www.audiodharma.org/ (I'm biased toward the latter because I re-built it over pandemic 😄). A talk from Gil that I like as an intro/overview of insight practice https://www.audiodharma.org/talks/9625 (starts around 2:30)
