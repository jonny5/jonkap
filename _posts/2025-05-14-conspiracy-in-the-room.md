Conspiracy in the Room



I didn't know what to expect when arriving at Shwee Oo Min Monastery and given my experience this was for the best. My arrival was neither a surprise to the women working in the office nor much fanfare. They processed me through in a business-like fashion. We picked up my mattress pad and headed to my room. Opening the door to the room, a scene unfolded unlike

I opened the door to my room, mattress pad in hand. 

 When I arrived I opened the door to my room. On one side was an older man laying in a bed on a laptop.

Unlike other retreats I had done in silence, here discussion was encouraged.

For the first week or so, most of our discussion was around the center and around meditation practice. We talked about our previous experience and what brought us to the center. For me, that meant my time at centers in California and the other time on my trip. He had spent time with several teachers and seemed to be looking for a guru as much as a guide.

He believed there could be a supernatural power to meditation. One of his teachers had written down a date and told him that was the day he would die. He told me he wants to go back to the teacher the day after the written date to prove him wrong. He started to laugh when describing it, and then abruptly stopped. He didn't think it was entirely implausible. He followed another teacher who was said to have traveled to astral planes and maybe even virtually to space.

I didn't find these very plausible, but I also understand how the mind can get into fairly different mental states as a result of meditation practice. I credited some of his belief to the fundamental mysteriousness of consciousness. We really do not understand much about why it exists, so I thought his way of filling in the gaps was following these gurus.

He then sprinkled in a few other comments, about the government and the CIA and their corruption. His anger describing it felt a little extreme, but I didn't think too much of it. The full realization of the level of conspiracy he subscribed to was distilled in happening to look at his many pill bottles and seeing one was an InfoWars serum.

Maybe as he grew more comfortable over our time he shared more of his thinking, and the extent of the conspiracies he followed. I mostly listened. He then described how a weather station in Alaska is actually creating hurricanes, and my science oriented brain felt the need to take stand.

This felt like a clear place I could explain a fundamental problem with a conspiracy like this one: physics. Even if the government was totally nefarious, I thought I could get through to him the impossibility of such an action. I tried to have a reasoned discussion that separated out potential nefarious government intentions from the total impracticality of sending enough energy from Alaska to the Gulf Coast to create a powerful hurricane.

As I laid out this logic, his retort involved something like "Where did you learn that? At your Ivy League school, or from the New York times?" and I realized that the debate was not going far.

So this was the setting I found myself practicing meditation. I tried to use this as a way of practicing Right Speech. One of the core teaching in Buddhism is the Eightfold Path and Right Speech is one of the eight components.

There are 3 main aspects to Right Speech: - is it kind - is it true - is it necessary

This provides some guidance on how to speak. Conversely there is how to listen. I have found staying embodied (keeping some attention grounded in the body) allows for more active listening. All of this served me well as a way of engaging with my roommate.

One important aspect is noticing how the body and mind are reacting naturally, and trying to act from a place of wisdom rather than the initial emotional place. I would not say I was totally successful, but there is a reason meditation is called a "practice".

One of the last days of the retreat, my roommate and another man had donated the breakfast. A monastery like this one runs entirely on donations and one act of generosity is to provide the means for a meal. He enlisted me as part of the team helping. We started upstairs, preparing the monastics tables and settings. During the breakfast service I was tasked with serving everyone their coffee, and it was very heart warming to have a nice small interaction with the people practicing at the monastery.

I couldn't get through to him in the realm of speech, but another component of the Eightfold Path is Right Action – and it felt like that morning we were able to practice that, fueled by his generosity.





















I opened the door to my home for the next two weeks. What greeted me was also not what I would expect for a retreat. I held my mattress pad in my hand. At this intended location, a basic bed frame was covered in various bottles and pills. On the other side of the room, an old man lay reclined, hands on his laptop. It was clear this was not going to be a typical retreat. 

This particular monastery, Shwee Oo Min, outside of Yangon, is led by Sayadaw U Tejaniya, who teaches an approach to mindfulness where you bring it to all aspects of life. As part of this, practitioners are encouraged to talk, listen to Q&As, and to engage in the Dharma, not just sitting silently, but throughout the day in a much looser container than retreats I had done before. 

And so my relationship with my new roommate would be no exception. It was not a silent sharing of space, but rather a constant dialogue. And this dialogue started in an interesting place. It told me about his life, about how he arrived at the monastery, and it turns out we had a fair amount in common.

We shared a first name, and we both came from the Bay Area. But our approaches to life and practice were not all that similar. 

He was clearly looking for some kind of guru or person to follow. He had told me of various places he had purchased, and through this, some more blandish views about the power of a teacher came out. For one, he thought a teacher of his had either dreamed or was able to, through their power, transport themselves onto a comet. Another teacher who he had followed closely and spent time at his monastery seemed to view him in sort of a mystical way. A specific detail that I won't forget is the teacher writing down on a piece of paper is a date, handing it to him and saying, This is the day you will die.

Pretty intense. And his retort was he was going to go back to that teacher the day after that date. Prove him wrong. This didn't seem like the healthiest relationship. 

But these beliefs about sort of the power of teachers and how they can bestow things on other people, while I was skeptical, there is some fundamental mysteriousness to consciousness, to how we process the world, how awareness functions. So when people have strange beliefs in this realm, it doesn't immediately cause me to contract.

As my time at the monastery continued, more little details of my roommate's worldview came to light. He would sprinkle in little things about current political situation, about the CIA, government, and while I treaded lightly and didn't feel particularly compelled to engage with these flittering, conspiratorial ideas.  

Somehow, though, on one particular day, he really dug deep into some of his views and gave me a full platter of conspiracies and government corruption and the dangers of the government, all these things. And I realized the depths of his belief. After this, I asked him to kind of outline for me his general, give me some specifics of more than just broad, classic CIA politicians are secretly corrupt in ways that have not been exposed. 

He outlined for me all kinds of terrible things that have been done by the government that have never come to light. And I still did not feel compelled to engage until finally a conspiracy he brought up of which I had not heard before triggered something in me. And this involved a weather station in Alaska. This weather station that I now know is called the High Frequency Active Oral Research Program, quite a mouthful, does some weather tracking. But in his mind, this weather station was creating hurricanes. And this conspiracy has now become more prevalent, I think, of, you know, government-created hurricanes.

This was prior to some of these more mainstream views of this. And this particular conspiracy bothered me not so much because it followed the same trend of the government balls being secretly working together, but pure physics of the matter. The fact that a weather station in Alaska physically could not create a hurricane off the coast of Florida, just the amount of energy involved was preposterous. 

And so I tried very calmly to explain this to my roommate, to tell him how even if the most evil government wanted to create a hurricane, we simply do not have the capabilities. And this is where I realized there was no arguing because his retort, while totally not productive, was also a good end to our engagement.

Because he asked, where did you learn that? Was it where you went to college? Since I happened to go into Ivy League school, that in and of itself is a whole other route of conspiracy. And so the conspiracies could breed more conspiracies. 

So as the retreat continued, occasionally these things would come up. He would engage with me and I think my skepticism about his beliefs both around consciousness and the power of teachers and these other conspiracies would sometimes rile him up and get him to start engaging with me. And I admit it would sometimes get to me and I would feel the need to argue back and without much productivity.

But the most productive part was the fact that we were at this monastery. And so I had this interesting ability to sort of feel his strong energy of these beliefs and let them sit with me. And in the moment that he's talking, I had noticed the reactivity, but not necessarily in a really deep way.

But since I was at this monastery, most of the rest of my time was spent sitting. So it was this interesting process of feeling all that energy, going into the meditation hall to sit and then sitting with that energy. And turned out that by doing so you can kind of let it dissipate in a healthy way and found that to be very useful practice of going back and forth between these different modalities. 

And this leads pretty nicely into the Buddhist concept of right speech. Right speech is one of the eight parts of the properly named Eightfold Path, and it relates directly to how we engage in relationship with others. The simplest explanation or distillation would be, before speaking, notice is what is about to be said. Is it true? Is it kind? And is it necessary? And that's sort of the very basic framework. There's also all the noticing of where the awareness is while you're speaking, while you're listening, how to engage with another person in a way that is healthy.

So while I would not say I was perfect in this with my roommate, I do think the practice was invaluable. I could sit and conveniently I was often sitting on my bed in a cross-legged position as he was talking. So I was able to be with the conversation in a way that was much less reactive than I may have been. 

And I think an important thing I was able to disentangle was discussing concepts versus attacking. I would say my roommate, unfortunately, was not so discerning, and his views of my skepticism were related to my own character flaws, and that's okay. And even that way of framing things caused me much less distress than it may have in another situation. 

And a final note on this roommate. I do think this paints him in a maybe less than flattering light. And so I want to end with the fact that people contain multitudes. He and another regular practitioner at the monastery on one of my last days there had donated the breakfast.

The way meals work at these monasteries is it's all donation based. And in practical terms, this means a monetary contribution that then channels into the actual food. 

And so on this day, with the food being donated by him, an act of generosity, he also asked if I wanted to participate in the ritual of the donation. This involved setting up the dining for the monks in the upstairs of the kitchen, helping with some preparation, and mostly serving everyone their morning coffee.

From the Western practitioners like myself, to the nuns, to all the visiting practitioners. And this was a very meaningful part of my time there was actually being able to engage in this small way with all the other people and partake in this flow of generosity.
