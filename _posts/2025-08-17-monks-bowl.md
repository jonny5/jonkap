Standing in a line, 
a row of hands,
holding bowls of food.

The monk approaches the first offering.

A spoon moves deliberately
from the rice bowl
to the monk's bowl
from the quinoa bowl
to the monk's bowl.
Paying more attention 
to the movement
than the volume

The monk approaches the final offering, 
looks down at his bowl,
and patiently explains:
"This is my only meal for the day you know"

He begins again.
A spoon moves.
All the rice
all the quinoa
fill his bowl
