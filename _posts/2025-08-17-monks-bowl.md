<pre class="poem">
A row of hands,
each offering a portion of food

The monk approaches my hands first
Iron bowl at the ready

Spoonfuls of rice
Coat the bottom of his bowl.
My mind attending to the movement
More than the portion.
Careful not to spill,
cautious of overfilling

He continues down the line,
each offering gently added,
then pauses.
His eyes move back and forth
from his half-empty bowl
to the remaining food:
"You know this meal has to last me all day, right?"

He begins again.
My spoon now a shovel,
rice pours from above.
My offering empty,
The monk's bowl full
