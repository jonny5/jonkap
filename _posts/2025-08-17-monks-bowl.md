<pre class="poem">
Standing in a line,
a row of hands,
holding bowls of food.

The monk approaches the first offering.

A spoon moves deliberately
from the rice bowl
to the monk's bowl
from the quinoa bowl
to the monk's bowl.
Paying more attention
to the movement
than the volume

The monk approaches the final offering,
looks down at his partially filled bowl
looks over to the remaining food and says:
"You know this meal has to last me all day, right?"

He begins again.
A spoon moves.
All the rice
all the quinoa
fill his bowl
