<pre class="poem">
A row of hands,
holding offerings of food

The monk approaches the first hands
Iron bowl at the ready

A spoon moves deliberately,
From the rice bowl
to the monk's bowl
From the quinoa bowl
to the monk's bowl.
Paying more attention
to the movement
than the portion

The monks approaches the final offering,
looks down at his half-empty bowl
looks over to the remaining food:
"You know this meal has to last me all day, right?"

He begins again.

A spoon moves,
All the rice
All the quinoa
fill the bowl
