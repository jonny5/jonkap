Right Speech and Conspiracy in my room

I opened the door to my room. On one side was an older man laying in a bed on a laptop. On the other was an empty bed frame covered in various medicine bottles and assorted items.

Unlike other retreats I had done in silence, here discussion was encouraged. 

For the first week or so most of our discussion was around the center and around meditation practice. We talked about our previous experience and what brought us to the center. For me, that meant my time at centers in California and the other time on my trip. He had spent time with several teachers and seemed to be looking for a guru as much as a guide. 

He believed there could be a supernatural power to meditation. One of his teachers had written down a date and said that was the day he would die. He said he wants to go back to the teacher the day after the date listed to prove him wrong. He started to laugh when describing it, and then stopped. He didn't think it was implausible. He had followed another teacher who was said to have traveled to astral planes and maybe even virtually to space.

I didn't find these very plausible, but I also understand how the mind can get into fairly different mental states as a result of meditation practice – and credited some of his beliefs about his teachers to the fundamental mysteriousness of consciousness. We really do not understand much about why it exists, so I thought his way of filling in the gaps was following these gurus.

He then sprinkled in a few other comments, about the government and the CIA and their corruption. His anger describing it felt a little extreme, but I didn't think too much of it.

The full realization of the level of conspiracy he subscribed to was distilled in happening to look at his many pill bottles and seeing one was an InfoWars serum.

This was the setting I found myself practicing meditation. So this felt like a good place to try to practice Right Speech. One of the core teaching in Buddhism is called the Eightfold Path – Right Speech is one of the components. There are 3 main aspects to Right Speech: is it kind, is it true and is it necessary. This provides some guidance on how to speak. Conversely there is how to listen. I have found staying embodied (keeping some attention grounded in the body) allows for more active listening.

All of this served me well as we discussed these conspiracies. At first I was hesitant to engage at all, but something about a particular conspiracy served as a point of argumentation.

The hurricane conspiracy was so implausible to me that my science minded brain couldn't fully let it go. I tried to have a reasoned discussion that separated out potential nefarious government intentions from the total impracticality of sending enough energy from Alaska to the Gulf Coast to create a powerful hurricane. 

My roommate was very animated about all of this and to him there was no distinction. This got me somewhat exasperated and I could feel the rise in emotion in my body. It was an interesting phenomenon, because for a day or two we would discuss this and other things, I would go sit in the meditation hall and then come back and he would still be animated about it. 

It was interesting to be face to face with conspiracy in this way. There is only some range of opinions I hear
