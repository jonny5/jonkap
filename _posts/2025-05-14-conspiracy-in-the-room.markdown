Right Speech and Conspiracy in my room

I opened the door to my room. On one side was an older man laying in a bed on a laptop. On the other was an empty bed frame covered in various medicine bottles and assorted items.

Unlike other retreats I had done in silence, here discussion was encouraged. 

For the first week or so, most of our discussion was around the center and around meditation practice. We talked about our previous experience and what brought us to the center. For me, that meant my time at centers in California and the other time on my trip. He had spent time with several teachers and seemed to be looking for a guru as much as a guide. 

He believed there could be a supernatural power to meditation. One of his teachers had written down a date and told him that was the day he would die. He said he wants to go back to the teacher the day after the written date to prove him wrong. He started to laugh when describing it, and then abruptly stopped. He didn't think it was entirely implausible. He followed another teacher who was said to have traveled to astral planes and maybe even virtually to space.

I didn't find these very plausible, but I also understand how the mind can get into fairly different mental states as a result of meditation practice. I credited some of his belief to the fundamental mysteriousness of consciousness. We really do not understand much about why it exists, so I thought his way of filling in the gaps was following these gurus.

He then sprinkled in a few other comments, about the government and the CIA and their corruption. His anger describing it felt a little extreme, but I didn't think too much of it. The full realization of the level of conspiracy he subscribed to was distilled in happening to look at his many pill bottles and seeing one was an InfoWars serum.

Maybe as he grew more comfortable over our time he shared more of his thinking, and the extent of the conspiracies he followed. I mostly listened. He then described how a weather station in Alaska is actually creating hurricanes, and my science oriented brain felt the need to take stand.

This felt like a clear place I could explain a fundamental problem with a conspiracy like this one: physics. Even if the government was totally nefarious, I thought I could get through to him the impossibility of such an action. I tried to have a reasoned discussion that separated out potential nefarious government intentions from the total impracticality of sending enough energy from Alaska to the Gulf Coast to create a powerful hurricane. 

As I laid out this logic, his retort involved something like "Where did you learn that? At your Ivy League school, or from the New York times?" and I realized that the debate was not going far.

So this was the setting I found myself practicing meditation. I tried to use this as a way of practicing Right Speech. One of the core teaching in Buddhism is the Eightfold Path and Right Speech is one of the eight components. 

There are 3 main aspects to Right Speech: 
- is it kind 
- is it true
- is it necessary

This provides some guidance on how to speak. Conversely there is how to listen. I have found staying embodied (keeping some attention grounded in the body) allows for more active listening. All of this served me well as a way of engaging with my roommate. 

One important aspect is noticing how the body and mind are reacting naturally, and trying to act from a place of wisdom rather than the initial emotional place. I would not say I was totally successful, but there is a reason meditation is called a "practice".

One of the last days of the retreat, my roommate and another man had donated the breakfast. A monastery like this one runs entirely on donations and one act of generosity is to provide the means for a meal. He enlisted me as part of the team helping. We started upstairs, preparing the monastics tables and settings. During the breakfast service I was tasked with serving everyone their coffee, and it was very heart warming to have a nice small interaction with the people practicing at the monastery. 

I couldn't get through to him in the realm of speech, but another component of the Eightfold Path is Right Action – and it felt like that morning we were able to practice that, fueled by his generosity.
