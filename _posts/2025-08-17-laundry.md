Each night, 
after the last sitting
I made my way down the hill 
to fold the kitchen laundry.

---

One night, 
with my heart open
I folded each apron and towel
Feeling connected
to tomorrow's cook
to tomorrow's dishwasher
Feeling grateful 
for my small contribution
to the next day's meal.

----

One night, 
with my mind foggy and tired
I folded each apron and towel
Thinking of more efficient ways,
I could operate the kitchen.
Why do the aprons get all tangled?
And how is it possible to use so many towels?
And why did I get the last job of the night?
And, And, And...
My arms finished folding,
as my mind kept going.

Lumbering back up the hill,
a sound of rustling nearby,
two eyes glowing
from the silhouette of a deer.
Our eyes locked,
perfectly still.

A moment later, 
the shadowy eyes vanished,
and so too did any agitation.
