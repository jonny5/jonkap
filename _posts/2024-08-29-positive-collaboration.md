The ways in which the internet and collaboration more generally can go badly are obvious. Unfortunately lots of social
media is an experiment in negative human collaboration.

Music represents a form of positive collaboration.

One of my favorite upbeat songs is this(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyeypSlBr4c). It's a fourth iteration of a song:

Original: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awIY7IgGDg0 Sampled in: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5SA6L722kI Covered by
Robyn: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5SA6L722kI And finally remixed by Bloody Beetroots. There is something very cool
about this, particularly that the final version couldn't exist without it's predecessors (and all the songs on the path
are somewhat different and cool).
