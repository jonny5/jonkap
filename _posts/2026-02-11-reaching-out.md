<pre class="poem">
Separate lives
each in their own world.
Arms reaching out blindly
for nourishment
growing closer
until they found each other.

A tumultuous night together
turned closeness into connection
– they became inseparable.
Through each storm
their bond solidified,
their fates intertwined.

Were they stronger together
or more vulnerable?

Can we keep reaching out,
not knowing who our branches will touch?
