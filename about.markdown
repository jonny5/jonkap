<h3>About me</h3>

<p>
  It's always tricky to label oneself. I am trying to do some writing and connection through this site. I am passionate
  about meditation and the teachings of the Buddha. I am a freelance software developer, and try to find ways to use
  technology in positive ways. To that end I manage the website <a href="wwww.audiodharma.org">Audiodharma</a> for the
  <a href="https://insightmeditationcenter.org">Insight Meditation Center</a>.
</p>

<h3>About the site</h3>

<p>
  Built with <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>. Thanks to <a href="https://gwern.net/">gwern.net</a> for some
  style inspiration/copying.
