Equanimity and chicks

Failing to catch an escaped chick humbled me.

I woke up one morning to find two chicks outside of their coop. I was in charge of them for a couple days. The task was pretty simple, to keep them fed and hydrated. The third task (which I had just discovered) was keeping them contained.



What made me feel particularly pathetic was that the escaped chicks and I had the same intention to get them back with the other chicks. Since I couldn't just explain this to them, I endlessly chased them around their enclosure. The enclosure was abutted against a building. There was just enough gap between the building and enclosure for the chicks to hide there. I tried blocking it off and this only led them to nearly get themselves trapped in my makeshift wall. When I finally did catch them, it involved a combination of patience and agility with a net. 

The first few times I was too cautious, and as I tried to net them gently they simply ran away. So it finally took the right combination of agility and patience to complete the task.

When it happened again though, the better strategy was to have more than one person involved. So I left it to the professionals (the folks who live at the farm).

Equanimity is a core concept in Buddhism that may not be as familiar outside of it. An image used to describe it is a steady ship in a turbulent ocean.
