Being outmaneuvered by a chick humbled me. My task on the farm was relatively simple: keeping a group of cooped up chicks fed and hydrated. I had just discovered a secret, more difficult task. Keeping them contained. 

One morning, with my mind still assembling itself from sleep, I trudged out into the foggy air. As I lifted the gate off the enclosure, I saw that it had not fully done its job of enclosing: two chicks were just outside of it. I kept to my first task and tended to the enclosed chick's diets. I hoped the appeal of food would entice the escaped chicks inside. This turned out not to be necessary. They were totally aligned on the idea of them getting back inside. They were making lots of noises and running in circles around the coop trying to get in, squawking at the chicken wire. 

The chicks had somehow escaped from under the coop, but the only way back in was from above. So I grabbed a net to try to wrangle them. We danced around the enclosure for a while. Whichever side of the enclosure I went on, they chose the opposite. Luckily, this dancefloor only extended a few feet from the cage, they were content playing ring around the rosy.

The voice of Werner Herzog from [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QhMo4WlBmGM) was playing over and over in my head. He describes the "enormity of the stupidity" of chickens and how easy they are to hypnotize. So I was stuck on being outmaneuvered by these seemingly simple creatures. I came up with a strategy to stop them. The enclosure abutted a wall, but there was a more than chick-sized gap between the wall and the coop that they kept retreating into. If I went to one side of it, they would pop out the other. So I built a barrier to try to put an end to our dancing and create a dead end. I shouldn't have underestimated their skills or their stupidity: they used their minimal flying ability to enmesh themself in my barrier, almost getting themselves fully ensnared in the process. I had to very gently move the barrier, just for them to escape out the other side again. 

The frustration mounted as we kept on dancing. I tried another trick, leaving a bit of food outside – hoping it would distract them from my lumbering presence. No luck, they were creatures of pure reactivity. 

I stopped trying to outsmart them as it did not affect them in the slightest and was testing my patience. Instead, I focused on the physical. With enough slow movement followed by a quick swoop of the net, I was able to snag one. I lifted the ensnared chick very gently, not wanting to injure it or cause it stress. This was a mistake. As soon as I lifted the net, the chick flew out. It pressed reset on our game and I was back on the chase.

I just needed the right, decisive action and it took me some practice. A few more trips around the coop and I finally got the first one, using more force than I was accustomed. The chick definitely didn't love the net, and it required me using my hand to gently hold it and release them into their enclosure. The second followed shortly after. Once they were inside, they happily joined their kin. They blended in totally, no sign of stress or discomfort that I could see.

One of the teachings of the Buddha is in "Right Effort" – practicing and living in a way that finds the balance between over exertion and over relaxation. This can show up in all kinds of ways. 

Mentally, I started off from a single minded, unskillful place. Werner Herzog's soothing German voice repeating the "enormity of stupidity" of chickens was doing me no favors. I was overthinking the fact that I *should* be able to outsmart the chick and not just focusing on the task at hand. I was applying my effort toward the wrong approach. For this simple task, more mental effort (and thinking of the perfect trap) wasn't what was necessary. Instead, the proper physical effort was sufficient. And that also took finding the right balance. Initially I was too focused on being gentle, moving to hold the chicks too slow and delicately. This actually caused them more grief and wanting to escape. Being firm and holding them such that they felt enclosed (without being too tight) allowed them to relax and me to complete the task. 

Paying attention can reveal whether or not I am applying the proper effort to a task. It can be most obvious in meditation, where the mind is allowed to be quieter. There is no concrete task to achieve, so it's easier to see if the mind is trying to work too hard to stay focused or relaxing too much and drifting.  

The chicks didn't need to be intelligent to teach me a valuable lesson on Right Effort. They also proved resilient, escaping the next day. I learned another important lesson: when to quit. I enlisted the professionals (a man who lives at the farm and his son) to captured the chicks using the power of two. They also addressed the more fundamental problem of shoring up the enclosure. One day of dancing was enough.
