Equanimity and chicks

Being outmaneuvered by a chick humbled me. My task on the farm was relatively simple: keeping a group of cooped up chicks fed and hydrated. I had just discovered a secret, more difficult task. Keeping them contained. 

On one morning, with my mind still assembling itself from sleep, I trudged out into the foggy air. I lifted the gate off the enclosure only to find that the enclosure hadn't fully done its job. Two chicks were just outside of it. I kept to my first task and tended to the enclosed chick's diets. I hoped the appeal of food would entice the escaped chicks inside. This turned out not to be necessary. They and I were totally aligned on the idea of them getting back inside. They were making lots of noises, and running in circles around the coop trying to get in, squawking through the chicken wire. There are many times with non human beings I have wanted to just explain to them their predicament and we could work toward a reasonable conclusion. Instead, I knew the reality. The voice of Werner Herzog from this video was playing over and over in my head:

I was thinking of solutions. Maybe if I knew hypnosis as the video suggested that would serve me.

They had somehow escaped underneath, but the only way I could get them back in was from above. So I grabbed a net to try to wrangle them. We danced around the enclosure for a while. Whichever side of the enclosure I went on, they chose the opposite. Luckily, this dancefloor only extended a few feet from the cage, they were content in a ring around the rosy.

I came up with a strategy to stop them. The enclosure abutted a wall, but there was a more than chick-sized gap between the wall and the coop. I did the natural thing and built a barrier to try to put an end to our dancing. I shouldn't have underestimated their skills, they used their minimal flying ability to enmesh themself in my barrier. Almost getting themselves fully ensnared in the process. I tried to distract them from my large lumbering presence with some food. No luck. Any movement on my end sent them darting back to that gap.

With enough slow movement, followed by a quick swoop of the net, I was able to snag one. Once the chick was ensnared I lifted it very gently, not wanting to injure it or cause it stress. This was a mistake. As soon as I lifted the net, the chick flew out. Pressing reset on our game, it was back to the chase.

I just needed the right, decisive action. It took me some practice. A few more trips around the coop and I finally I got the first one, using more force than I was accustomed. The second followed shortly after. They definitely didn't love the net, and it required me using my hand to gently hold them and release them into their enclosure. Once they were inside, they happily joined their kin. They blended in totally, no sign of stress or discomfort that I could see. My body relaxed with the satisfaction of completing the seemingly simple task.

One of the teachings of the Buddha is in "Right Effort" – practicing and living in a way that finds the balance between over exertion and over relaxation. My swoop of the net started with the wrong type of effort. I was too intentional about being gentle and slow without the requisite force required actually achieve the task.

This balance shows up most clearly in meditation, where there can be a tendency to strive and exert and make something happen. Wise effort means tempering this with relaxing the mind. 

It's also helpful to notice reactivity. Werner Herzog's voice in my head wasn't doing me any favors, I was overthinking the fact that I couldn't outsmart a chick. Instead, had I just focused on taking the appropriate, patient action – I could have saved myself a bit of grief.

The next day, when it happened again, I employed a smarter strategy. I informed the professionals (one of the folks who live at the farm plus his son)  of my predicament. The duo were much more effective and also addressed the more fundamental problem of shoring up the enclosure. So there is Right Effort, and then there is also wisdom. Sometimes that means not relying only on oneself to solve the problem.
