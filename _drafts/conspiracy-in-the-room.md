Conspiracy in My Room

Carrying my mattress pad in hand, I opened the door to my room at the monastery. A basic room greeted me: an empty frame for my pad, a small desk, and another bed for my roommate. Except my bedframe wasn't empty, various bottles and knick-knacks were strewn across where my mattress was meant to go. And the other bed was fully occupied by an older man lying supine, typing away at a laptop balanced on his belly.

I had known this was going to be different from previous retreats I had done, which were largely in silence with minimal stimulation. I was at Shwee Oo Min Monastery in Burma, led by Sayadaw U Tejaniya. He encourages a form of practice to bring mindfulness to all aspects of life, which includes encouraging discussion. So sharing a room meant having a more substantial relationship than just another body sleeping in the same space.

So I began chatting with my new roommate. Quickly it was clear we had some things in common, we shared first names and both had spent large parts of life in the Bay Area. I could see why we were paired together.

For the first couple days, our conversations largely centered around the center and meditation practice more broadly. We talked about our previous experience and what brought us to the center. For me, that meant my time mostly practicing in California and the earlier parts of my trip. He gave me a more full backstory of his life[^1] and his journey with several teachers and monasteries in Asia. It was clear he was looking for a guru more than just meditation guidance.  

One of his teachers had written down a date and told him that was the day he would die. He wanted to go back to the teacher the day after the fateful written date to prove him wrong. He started to laugh when describing it, and then abruptly stopped. I could tell he didn't think it was entirely implausible. He then followed another teacher who he believed to have traveled to astral planes and virtually to space.

I am naturally skeptical and his view of the supernatural with these teachers was no exception. But I have seen how meditation can create fairly different mental states, so I didn't think too deeply about his beliefs and chalked them up to the fundamental mysteriousness of consciousness.

As we kept talking over the next few days, more opinions emerged - thoughts about government corruption, the CIA, various nefarious schemes. While there was often a kernel of truth, his appetite for conspiracies was clearly large. I mostly just listened. 

At one point I asked him what are some other things the government was doing. He outlined how a weather station in Alaska was being used to create hurricanes off the Gulf Coast[^2]. Here my ability to just listen ended. While I wasn't going to argue about the motivations of politicians or US foreign policy, I felt had to defend basic physics. Part of the conversation went something like:

Me: Even the most evil government in the world couldn't physically create a hurricane. The amount of power needed would be astronomical. And how would you even transfer that energy from Alaska to the Atlantic?

Him: Where did you learn that? At your Ivy League school? From the New York Times?

Me: This is just how the world works. Any physicist would tell you the same thing.

Him: Sure, physicists who were taught at the same corrupt universities.

I could feel myself getting more animated as we went back and forth. Where I saw a clear line between scientific understanding and human motivations, he saw conspiracy all the way down. 

Later, I took a closer look at the bottles that had been strewn across my bed that first day. One of them bore the logo of Alex Jones' InfoWars. I couldn't have asked for a clearer sign. And it had been there from the start.

So this was the setting I found myself practicing meditation. I tried to use this as a way of practicing Right Speech[^3]. There are 3 main aspects to Right Speech: 

- is it kind
- is it true 
- is it necessary

This provides guidance on how to speak. Conversely there is how to listen. With my roomate, our room setup was supportive of this. I would be sitting cross legged on my bed when our discussions took place. So was able to better be with my body and notice my reactivity at some of his more outlandish claims.  I found when he came after me personally my chest had a much stronger reaction than claims about the government,

I practiced as best I could in the moment. What really helped though was to go to the meditation hall after one of these heated discussions, and really watch my body there. Eventually, I could see the agitation dissipitate. Then the thought might arise again: "How can I prove to him the error in his thinking???" and then again would try to observe as my body eventually relaxed.

One important aspect is noticing how the body and mind are reacting naturally, and trying to act from a place of wisdom rather than the initial emotional place. I would not say I was totally successful, but there is a reason meditation is called a "practice".

Toward the end of my time at the monastery, my roommate and another man had donated the breakfast[^4]. He enlisted me as part of the team helping. We started upstairs, preparing the monastics tables and settings. During the breakfast service I was tasked with serving everyone their coffee, and it was very heart warming to have a nice small interaction with the people practicing at the monastery.

I couldn't get through to him in the realm of speech, but another component of the Eightfold Path is Right Action – and it felt like that morning we were able to practice that, fueled by his generosity.
