Conspiracy in My Room

I opened the door to my room at the monastery, mattress in hand. Where my mattress was meant to go, the bedframe was covered in various bottles and knick knacks. On the other side of the room lay my new roommate, typing away on a laptop. The scene before me a stark contrast to other places I practiced – where one mostly kept to themselves and avoided all external stimulation. 

Importantly, while other retreats had been in silence, here discussion was encouraged. So sharing a room meant having a proper roommate. Quickly it was clear we had some things in common, we shared first names and both had spent large parts of life in the Bay Area.

For the first couple days, we mostly discussed the center and meditation practice more broadly. We talked about our previous experience and what brought us to the center. For me, that meant my time at centers in California and the earlier parts of my trip. His time had been with several teachers in Asia. He was looking as much for a guru as for meditation guidance.  

One of his teachers had written down a date and told him that was the day he would die. He wanted to go back to the teacher the day after the fateful written date to prove him wrong[^1]. He started to laugh when describing it, and then abruptly stopped. I could tell he didn't think it was entirely implausible. He followed another teacher who he believed to have traveled to astral planes and virtually to space.

I didn't find these very plausible, but I also understand how the mind can get into fairly different mental states as a result of meditation practice. I credited some of his belief to the fundamental mysteriousness of consciousness. We really do not understand much about why it exists, so I figured his way of filling in the gaps was following these gurus.

He then sprinkled in a few other comments, about the government and the CIA and their corruption. His anger describing it felt a little extreme, but I didn't think too much of it. Maybe as he grew more comfortable over our time he shared more of his thinking and he went on in a lot more detail about the government and I could see his appetite for conspiracies was large. I mostly listened. With some curiousity I asked him to give me some examples of government corruption. 

The example that stayed with me was also new to me: a conspiracy around a weather station in Alaska. Specifically that it was being used to create hurricanes off of the Gulf Coast[^2]. This was a bridge too far for me. Most of what he had previously outlined to me were thinking groups or individuals had nefarious motives where I was skeptical. Arguing over the inner workings of a government officials mind did not feel worthy. Here though, we were talking clear physics. 

I tried to explain that even the most evil government in the world physically could not create a hurricane. I outlined the amount of power that would be needed would be astronomical, let alone the logistics of somehow transferring that energy from Alaska to the Atlantic Ocean. This seemed clear to me, if something is physically impossible no amount of motivation would be sufficient.

We went back and forth. His retort that mostliy ended the debate was something like "Where did you learn that? At your Ivy League school, or from the New York Times?" and I realized that the debate was not going far. To him, the conspiracy could spread all the way to all the physicists, meteorologists and journalists. 

One day toward the end of my time, I happened to take a closer look at the bottles that had littered my be on arrival. One of them was a serum for Alex Jones' InfoWars. A more observant eye on my part could have had me understand his view of of he world much sooner.

So this was the setting I found myself practicing meditation. I tried to use this as a way of practicing Right Speech[^3]. There are 3 main aspects to Right Speech: 

- is it kind
- is it true 
- is it necessary

This provides guidance on how to speak. Conversely there is how to listen. With my roomate, our room setup was supportive of this. I would be sitting cross legged on my bed when our discussions took place. So was able to better be with my body and notice my reactivity at some of his more outlandish claims.  I found when he came after me personally my chest had a much stronger reaction than claims about the government,

I practiced as best I could in the moment. What really helped though was to go to the meditation hall after one of these heated discussions, and really watch my body there. Eventually, I could see the agitation dissipitate. Then the thought might arise again: "How can I prove to him the error in his thinking???" and then again would try to observe as my body eventually relaxed.

One important aspect is noticing how the body and mind are reacting naturally, and trying to act from a place of wisdom rather than the initial emotional place. I would not say I was totally successful, but there is a reason meditation is called a "practice".

Toward the end of my time at the monastery, my roommate and another man had donated the breakfast[^4]. He enlisted me as part of the team helping. We started upstairs, preparing the monastics tables and settings. During the breakfast service I was tasked with serving everyone their coffee, and it was very heart warming to have a nice small interaction with the people practicing at the monastery.

I couldn't get through to him in the realm of speech, but another component of the Eightfold Path is Right Action – and it felt like that morning we were able to practice that, fueled by his generosity.
