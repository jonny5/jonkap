I stared up at the ceiling fan, unable to fall asleep. An observer may have thoughtmy roommate was keeping me up. This was an unintended roomate: a white gecko stationed itself along the wall by my bed. It's simple clear color contrasting starkly with the hotel room's red walls. He wasn't my primary concern, nor was the heat. A much simpler problem occupied my mind: what time should I set my alarm to wake me up?

I was in Bagan, the land of a thousand pagodas. The sunrise view was meant to be incredible. That sounded nice. It also meant waking up early. And I like to prioritize a good night's sleep. And there were many logistics involved. And I am naturally kind of lazy, And... And...

The list of pros and cons ballooned in my head. I finally came up with one item on the "pro" side that felt decisive: the number printed on my bus seat ticket. It was my last night in Bagan and I would be taking an all day bus ride the following day. I remembered that my seat number was 12. Pretty much every possible configuration I could think of involved this seat being a window. I am well practiced in sleeping against a window, so that settled it. I decided I could sleep on the bus, so I set my alarm to see the sunrise.

Not enough hours later, I hopped on a bicycle and sweated my way through the early morning and up a hill to a viewing area. I got there a few minutes early, with the sun just starting to peek out. The ancient pagodas started as shadows in my dimly lit surroundings. As the sun began to hit them their regular orange was replaced by a pastel pink. The sun rose and the hot air balloons followed. These too started as black shadows in the sky and then became distinct colored groups, each fleet with its own style. The slow march of rainbow over the softly lit stone was a feast for the eyes. I felt I had made the right decision.

To my planning mind, equally satisfying was what followed. I biked back, grabbed breakfast, and boarded the bus with time to spare. Everything lined up just right. I smiled as I boarded, seeing two seats per row, the first row starting with 1. No shenanigans, a standard bus configuration. Many things differ by culture, it turned out the numbering on a bus is universal (option A from the choices above to be specific). My calculation was correct.

I approached my row, with confidence that seat 12 would be a window – and it was. There was a crucial detail that all my planning couldn't have factored in. Seat 12 was not just already occupied, it was fully taken over. A blanket draped carefully, toys all around, and snacks tucked into the seat pocket. A young mother sat there with her baby on her lap. I smiled at them and without hesitating I settled into aisle seat 11.

One of the potentially radical teachings from the Buddha is on the sense doors. Normally, it's thought that humans have five senses: touch, sight, sound, taste, smell. The sixth sense in the Buddha's teaching is "thinking".

Thinking can feel much more important than our other senses. It does have a large impact in the world. And it can feel particularly important because thinking is often how we respond to our other senses. A classic example used to demonstrate this is seeing something coiled on a trail. The thinking mind can interpret this sight as "snake" and become fearful, only on closer inspection to see that it's a piece or rope and relax. 

Meditating is a clear way of noticing thinking as a sense. One benefit of sitting silently in meditation is that during that period there is nothing that needs to be done. While many thoughts can come, knowing that they do not need to be acted upon can give more capacity to let them arise and pass away.  "Planning" is a common theme for thoughts in my mind. This often comes from discomfort in uncertainty (grappling with not knowing what the future holds). There is also the alluring pleasure of a plan properly coming together  as I imagined. And this was what arose when I entered that bus and my previous night's logic seemed to hold  up.

As shown by what followed, reality is not beholden to our plan, this pleasure is not reliable. One response to this is to fight it, to try to make reality fit the plan. I could have done this – shown the mother my ticket, demanding she switched seats (the beloved window would be all mine!). This is definitely **a** strategy. The clearest problem with this approach is the resulting feelings it would require of me: the initial anger, the resulting discomfort. And just as important, all that thrashing does not mean success ("The best-laid plans of mice and men often go awry").

Luckily this wasn't my approach or the emotions that were evoked in me. Instead, I could instantly see the humor in my plan being so clearly foiled. Seeing that my logic around seat number 12 being ultimately "right" and simultaneously meaningless. And it all worked out just fine. Appropriately enough, one of my teachers specifically mentions using the thoughts that occur when lying in bed before sleep as a time to practice letting go of thoughts.[^1] It's rare for thoughts produced in this state to be truly useful, and if it has some importance in all likelihood it will come up again when it is needed. Keeping this in mind was helpful in being OK with how the day played out.

It's important to remember that it is just a sense. It takes wisdom to know when a thought is worth honoring, and when, like my seat, it is worth letting go.
