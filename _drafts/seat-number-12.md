I stared up at the ceiling fan, unable to fall asleep. What may have kept up was an unintended roommate that joined me, a white gecko stationed in stark contrast to the hotel room's red walls. He wasn't my primary concern, nor was the heat. A much simpler problem occupied my mind: what time should I set my alarm to wake me up?

I was in Bagan, the land of a thousand pagodas. The sunrise view was meant to be incredible. That sounded nice. It also meant waking up early when I like to prioritize a good night's sleep. And there were many logistics involved. And I am naturally kind of lazy, and... and...

The list of pros and cons ballooned in my head. I finally came up with one item on the "pro" side that felt decisive: the number printed on my bus seat ticket. It was my last night in Bagan and I would be taking an all day bus ride the following day. I remembered that my seat number was 12. Pretty much every possible configuration I could think of involved this seat being a window. I am well practiced with sleeping against a window, so that settled it. I decided I could sleep on the bus and I set my alarm for before sunrise.

Not enough hours later, I hopped on a bicycle and sweated my way through the early morning and up a hill to a viewing area. I got there a few minutes early, with the sun just starting to peek out. The ancient pagodas started as shadows, when the sun began to hit them their regular orange was replaced by a pastel pink. As the sun rose, so did the hot air balloons. These too started as black shadows in the sky and then became distinct colored groups, each fleet with its own style. My eyes contentedly took in the slow march of rainbow over the softly lit stone. It was a beautiful scene. I felt I had made the right decision.

To my planning mind, equally satisfying was what followed. I biked back, grabbed breakfast, and boarded the bus with time to spare. Everything lined up just right. I smiled as I boarded, seeing two seats per row, the first row starting with 1. No shenanigans, a standard bus configuration. Many things differ by culture, it turned out the numbering on a bus is universal (option A from the choices above to be specific). My calculation was correct.

I approached my row, with confidence that seat number 12 would be a window – and it was. All my planning couldn't have factored in one crucial detail. Seat number 12 was not just already occupied, it was fully taken over. A blanket draped carefully, toys all around, and snacks tucked into the seat pocket. A young mother sat there with her baby. I smiled at them, without hesitating I settled into seat 11.

One of the potentially radical teachings from the Buddha is on the sense doors. Normally, it's thought that humans have five senses: touch, sight, sound, taste, smell. The sixth sense in the Buddha's teaching is "thinking".

Thoughts can feel much more important than our other senses. Particularly because they often occur in response to them. Seeing a bear on TV and seeing a bear emerge a few feet away are both technically "seeing". The two scenarios will (understandably) prompt very different thoughts.

With careful attention, it's possible to see how the mind is constantly creating thoughts. And this gives the capacity to choose whether or not to take them seriously. "Planning" is a common theme for thoughts in my mind. There is a certain pleasure my mind gets when a plan comes together. So I could feel the delight when I entered that bus and my previous night's logic held up.

As shown by what followed, reality is not beholden to our plans. One way to deal with this is fight it. I could have done this – shown the mother my ticket, demanded she switched seats, and sit by my beloved window. This is definitely **a** strategy. There are two clear problems with this approach: what it will do to the heart and mind, and that it is still not reliable. 

Meditating is a clear way of noticing this. Seeing how many thoughts the mind can produce and how many are not useful can be very profound. 

A helpful teaching from one of my teachers is to really discount the thoughts that occur while lying in bed at night trying to fall asleep. It's rare for anything useful to arise in these moments, and most likely they will arise again if they are truly wise.
