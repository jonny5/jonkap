I stared up at the ceiling fan, unable to fall asleep. An observer may have thought it was my roommate was keeping me up. My single room was occupied by a surprise guest: a white gecko who stationed itself along the wall by my bed, it's empty color contrasting starkly with the hotel room's red walls. He wasn't my primary concern, nor was the heat. A much simpler problem was keeping me up: what time should I set my alarm to wake me up?

I was in Bagan, the land of a thousand pagodas. The sunrise view was meant to be incredible. That sounded nice. It also meant waking up early. And I like to prioritize a good night's sleep. And there were many logistics involved. And I am naturally kind of lazy, And... And...

The list of pros and cons ballooned in my head. I finally came up with one item on the "pro" side that felt decisive: the number printed on my bus seat ticket. It was my last night in Bagan and I would be taking an all day bus ride the following day. I remembered that my seat number was 12. I pictured all the configurations of seat 12 in my mind:



I even imagined if for some reason in Burma they started with number 0, seat 12 would *still* be a window:



I am well practiced in sleeping against a window, so that settled it. I could sleep on the bus, so I set my alarm to see the sunrise.

Not enough hours later, I hopped on a bicycle and sweated my way through the early morning and up a hill to a viewing area. I got there a few minutes early, with the sun just starting to peek out. The ancient pagodas started as shadows in my dimly lit surroundings. As the light began to hit them their regular orange was replaced by a pastel pink. The sun rose and the hot air balloons followed. These too started as black shadows in the sky and then became distinct colored groups, each fleet with its own style. The slow march of rainbow over the softly lit stone was a feast for the eyes. I felt I had made the right decision.

To my planning mind, equally satisfying was what followed. I biked back, grabbed breakfast, and boarded the bus with time to spare. Everything lined up just right. I smiled as I boarded, seeing two seats per row, the first row starting with 1. No shenanigans, a standard bus configuration (the first option from my mind's calculations above). Many things differ by culture, it turned out the numbering on a bus is universal. My calculation proved correct.

I approached my row, with confidence that seat 12 would be a window – and it was. There was a crucial detail awaiting me, one that all my machinations couldn't have anticipated. Seat 12 was not just already occupied, it was fully taken over. A blanket draped carefully, toys all around, and snacks tucked into the seat pocket. A young mother sat there with her baby on her lap. I smiled at them and without hesitating I settled into aisle seat 11.

A valuable teaching from the Buddha is on the sense doors. Normally, it's thought that humans have five senses: touch, sight, sound, taste, and smell. In the Buddha's teaching, the sixth sense is "thinking". Thinking can feel distinct and important, so treating it as a sense may not be intuitive. We have direct ways of engaging with the world and then our reaction and mental activity around them (this is where thinking comes in). So the teaching illustrates that all of our experience is contained within these six senses.

Meditating is a clear way of noticing thinking as a sense. There is nothing that needs to be done or acted upon while sitting. Many thoughts can come, and knowing that they do not need to be acted upon can give more capacity to let them arise and pass away. "Planning" is a common theme for thoughts in my mind. This can be a reaction to the discomfort of uncertainty (grappling with not knowing what the future holds). Conversely there is the pleasurable allure of a plan properly coming together as I imagined. The latter is was what arose when I entered that bus and my previous night's logic seemed to hold up.

As shown by what followed, reality is not beholden to any plan. As Burns said: "The best-laid plans of mice and men often go awry". One response to this is to fight, to try to make reality fit the plan. I could have done this – shown the mother my ticket, demanding she switched seats. The beloved window would've been all mine! This is definitely **a** strategy. In this particular scenario it's hopefully clear why that would've been unwise. And just as important, all that thrashing wouldn't even ensure success. 

Instead, I saw the humor in my plan being so clearly foiled; my logic around seat number 12 being ultimately "right" and also meaningless. And it all worked out just fine. I rested fine in the aisle seat and had the entertainment of a cute baby next to me. This is a simple and trivial example of being ok with a plan failing, but I hope its illustrative. This isn't to say there are no plans worth pursuing, I am specifically intending to highlight the emotional reaction to when a plan fails. It's a clear place to see one of the core Buddhist teachings: stress is the result of discontent or discomfort with the present moment.

Appropriately, one of my teachers, Tempel Smith, specifically mentions lying in bed before sleep as a time to practice letting go of thoughts.[^2] Rarely are the thoughts produced at this time useful, and they will most likely come up again in a more wakeful state if they are important. I had remembered that teaching, so that also aided in my contentment of how the scene played out.

Thinking can feel important, it dictates so much of our lives and the world around us. Remembering it is just a sense gives more control over it. And it takes wisdom to know when a thought is worth honoring, and when, like seat 12, it is worth letting go.
