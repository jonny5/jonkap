Separate lives, 

each in their own world.

Arms reaching out 

blindly, for nourishment.

Growing closer, 

until they found each other.



A tumultuous night together 

turned closeness into something deeper. 

They became inseparable. 



Through each storm, 

their bond solidified, 

their fates intertwined.



Were they stronger together

or more vulnerable?



Can we all keep reaching out,

not knowing who our branches will touch?
