If I find the right type of song, I have a habit of listening to it repeatedly while exercising. Often this will mean I get sick of it. If it hits just the right way though, it will persist on my playlists and stay with me.

Robyn's music will often break through this barrier. Particularly electronic heavy songs where she is the featured vocalist, these hit some kind of sweet spot for me. One I initially kept coming back to was Royksopp's The Girl and the Robot. I looked for other songs with a similar style I came across this one: [Robyn – Cobrastyle (Bloody Beetroots remix)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyeypSlBr4c). It has persisted on my regular rotation for a long time; the changing beat, vocals and repetition click with my brain. 

The appeal of the song is also contained in its origins. My first few listens I wasn't so focused on the lyrics, just the overall vibe. As I kept listening I got more curious about it. So I listened to [the non remixed version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5SA6L722kI) (which is also great and has a breezier feel). Didn't feel like a typical Robyn song, and that's because it's a cover of [this (quite popular) song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5SA6L722kI). This song in turn makes heavy use of [Mad Cobra's song Press Trigger](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awIY7IgGDg0) which was part of an album called Buzz Riddim where artists created their songs over beats.

So the full timeline:
- A producer Troyton Rami creates Buzz Riddim (Sean Paul's Give Me The Light is also on this album, can hear the same beat)
- Mad Cobra raps over it
- Teddybears samples the rapping over their own beat, creates Cobrastyle
- Robyn covers the Teddybears song
- Bloody Beetroots remixes the cover
- I listen :) 

Pretty amazing. The number of ears and hands involved, the amount of inspiration and amount of variation that came along. There are countless ways in which inspiration and influence come into any work of art. Music provides a very tangible way of seeing how one thing can influence another because one can directly sample a song[^1]. In this case each song along the way has its own appeal – if you do listen to all the iterations I'd be curious which version along the path you prefer. And seeing the full picture, there would be no way to see

Now to the Buddhist connection, as I will tend to look for on most of my posts. I will often go to a half day retreat at IMC, and the head teacher Gil will end the day with a simple dedication of the day of practice, hoping that any good that comes from sitting peacefully will spread out into the world. He will give small examples of just being a bit more patient in traffic or friendlier to someone at a cafe. The ripples of actions we take are both more profound and more widespread than we can imagine. Music provides a very tangible way of seeing how one thing can influence another, but that is just a clear example. It's hard to know the impact one can have, so acting with kindness and care toward the world (including to ourselves!) is the only sensible path forward. And that is my intention of writing, even if just one person reads something, and gets inspired, who knows where those ripples where land.
