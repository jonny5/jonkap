Of the many forms of suffering happening in the world, one that my mind goes to frequently is the people of Burma*.
Starting with the coup in 2021 and more recently with a serious earthquake in 2025. I am quite fond of the people I met
there (and selfishly would like to be able to visit again).

Being an obvious tourist, I have seen myself transformed into a walking neon dollar sign. While totally understandable,
it often makes for a challenging experience. The combination of haggling, potential scams and the inability to feel like
even giving some money will make much of a difference all made me almost change my travel plans. This is all to lay the
groundwork for the contrast of many of the people I met in Burma, where I rarely felt this way. Generosity was a core
guiding principle of many of my interactions and I was very touched seeing it in practice.

As I gathered my belongings from my taxi, ending a nearly 3 month trip, I held out all my remaining cash for the driver
– planning on giving him a generous tip. I've done this in other countries, simplifying my exchange with a small act of
generosity. This taxi driver in particular was extra deserving. I had forgotten to return my room key from the monastery
where he picked me up. He was kind enough to say he would return it.

As I was holding out the cash, he took a look and decided what was a reasonable tip (it was much less than I offered). I
gave one verbal nudge that it was all for him and he shook his head. When I had asked him to take the key back, that
seemed to bring him more joy than taking a tip. But now his generosity has lasted in me, more than anything I did for
him.

From getting my pants fixed and repairing a flat bicycle tire, normal transactions became real acts of generosity by the
service provider.

The Young Monk

A long series of steps leads to a beautiful outlook called Mandalay Hill. I went there for that view at sunset. I didn't
know that the more meaningful thing would be in the other direction away from the view. Being a popular tourist spot, it
is also a place that locals would travel to practice english with tourists. While the view was impressive, talking with
local folks was more compelling. And one group in particular stood out, a few young monks with a group of students.

The monk invited us to his temple. He took it over.

We were split into different groups of students and they asked us questions as a way to practice english. I felt kind of
like a celebrity being interviewed. When they asked me what music I liked and they were familiar, they were happy that
we shared the connection.

I was very inspired by the dedication to teaching and to practice this monk had taken. He embodied living a life of
service.

The banh mi

The full arc of meeting Sane started on the bus (seat number #12 link). I was the only non Burmese speaker on the bus.
We stopped for food halfway through at a semi outdoor cafe where I wouldn't have normally gotten anything. Sane offered
to have me sit with her and her friends and ordered me some food.

She offered to hold my seatmate's baby while she got her luggage. And when we were leaving she explained my options to
get to the hotel and helped me get a cab.

She then showed me around a bit and took me to an area with a nice view. She insisted that she was hosting me and wanted
to get me something, so she got me a drink and herself a banh mi. She was very excited for the banh mi. A very young kid
came up to us and asked for food, she didn't even hesitate giving the rest of it to him.

The final act was we walked by the trash can where the kid had left some of the sandwich and the wrapper and she threw
it away.

This whole interaction really has stuck with me and embodies the full generosity that is possible to have.

* Both the names Myanmar and Burma are used. Burma comes from colonial era, Myanmar comes from the military so I could .
Given the current situation and calling the people Burmese I'll use Burma.
