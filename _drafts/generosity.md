I held out all my remaining kyat[^1] for my taxi driver. This would amount to a generous tip, about the same as the ride itself. I had done this in other countries, as a way to combine generosity and practicality. If I had planned well enough and only left myself with a bit of cash left, this was a nice way of ending my time in a country and giving to the taxi drivers, whom I would not envy for the chaos of driving in many of the world's large cities.

This driver was particularly deserving. I had realized a few minutes in to the ride to the airport that I had forgot to return my room key to the monastery. I asked the driver if he would be going to back to the monastery soon, and he was more than happy to help me out. Rather than be annoyed at my request, he smiled and seemed delighted for the good karma of doing this deed.

So it felt particularly appropriate to give him this large tip. He did not take the stack of bills when I tried handing them to him. Instead, he fanned them out. I was a little put off, not knowing what he was doing. It quickly became clear, he was assessing the amount and took what he felt was an appropriate tip. He portioned himself a reasonable tip, still leaving me with some bills. He seemed happier when I had asked him for a favor (returning the key) than he was getting the tip.



The Young Monk

I arrived in Mandalay without much of a plan. Luckily, I had made a friend on the trip and she knew of one of the prime things to do there – climb the steps of Mandalay Hill and see the sunset. It it is a nice, steady climb up many steps, through pagodas and ultimately to a beautiful view overlooking the whole city and river, with a pastel sunset. 

What turned out to be more meaningful was in the opposite direction, away from the view. We had happened to come to the top of the hill on a popular day for locals. While we were there as tourists, locals were there to practice other languages (particularly English). They were very kind about it, humble about their own limitations (even when they were quite good) and it allowed for more regular conversation. There were a bunch of different groups of all ages. Most notably, a group of several young monks and a class of students they were teaching. My friend and I split off, taking questions and trying to engage with them. The whole way down we talked with the monks. It was a sweet interaction, but also amidst the sun setting and the amount of people on the hill it was a lot all at once.

I learned that the monk named Ashin Kosalla had taken over a monastery that needed leadership, and in the process started teaching students there in a classroom that was on the property. He invited us to visit and help the students practice some English, and we took him up on the offer a few days later.

He was generously insistent on picking us up, and so he found us at our hostel (with his friend who drives, monks do not drive) and brought us to the classroom. We talked a bit with the whole class, and then again split off into two groups. The students practiced a bit of their english asking us questions and I did my best to answer clearly. It ended up being a bit more like an interview, and I felt kind of like a celebrity. A specific question that I remember is around what music I liked. When they had heard of the artist or liked them too they audibly approved. There is something beautiful about global culture in this way, that there was something natural we could bond over.

After the class, he gave us a tour of the monastery and explained how he had taken on this role of managing it. He was quite young and it seemed like a lot of responsibility. His dedication to service and to helping students learn was really inspiring. I know I would have a lot of fear of the undertaking. He treated us to food and tea and was a very gracious host. This was another instance of him doing me a big favor, allowing me to connect a more deeply than I normally would in a tourist setting. And he was gracious for having us come visit when it was him doing the favor.

He kept me updated that he was still teaching years later, providing students with a valuable outlet even amidst the political strife in Burma.



The Banh Mi

On the bus to Yangon (see Seat #12) I was the only obvious foreigner (non Burmese speaker). Halfway through the long bus ride, it stopped for food at a cafe. I had prepared for the ride and didn't intend on eating anything, having packed some protein bars and snacks. 

A young woman named Sane waved me over to a table next to her and her friends. She spoke good English, and ordered me something vegetarian on the menu, something that would not have been doable on my own. When we disembarked in Yangon, she offered to hold my seatmate's newborn as she gathered her belongings. And when we got off she helped me amidst the chaos, giving me the options of how to get to my hotel. I settled on a taxi and she communicated with the driver for me.

I was mostly intending on just resting in Yangon, this was a bit of a transition. I had spent 2 months traveling and would end my trip at a monastery after this. Sane offered to show me around a bit, so we met in the central area and took transit to a shopping mall. We walked around a bit and she was insistent as the guide and city host that she would get me something. I settled on a drink, and she got herself a banh mi. She had really hyped up this banh mi, saying it was her favorite spot for food. We walked out to the water and found a nice place to sit. We had a nice conversation, as she ate her banh mi and I sipped my drink. 

A young boy came by, asking for food. Without hesitating, she gave him half her sandwich. I felt like there wasn't even any extra thought, the decision came naturally to her. When we got up to walk around some more, the boy had left the ends of the sandwich and the wrapper on the ground, not throwing it away. Again she just picked it up and threw it out without any reactivity, no feeling of ungratefulness or negativity toward the kid.



Generosity is a core teaching of the Buddha, considered one of the 7 perfections (paramis). Nowhere in my months of traveling did I feel it's presence more vividly than in the way I was treated in Burma. 

The logistics (at the time I went) were that I could get a 1 month tourist visa. I had debated how long to spend at the monastery and how long to spend traveling, so I split it about in the middle. This turned out to be wise, as I learned as much from the people I met and their generosity as I did later at the monastery.

The key aspect was that in each of these interactions the generosity seemed to flow naturally it was embodied in my driver, in Ashin and in Sane. They were not forcing it and made me feel very welcome. This is often not the case as a tourist[^2] . I don't begrudge being seen as a source of income to local people when that is the case, as that is part of the nature of being a tourist. However, it made it all the more refreshing and heart warming to feel the flip side of that, particularly since it was the end of the trip.









[^1] Money in Myanmar/Burma. Both the names Myanmar and Burma are used. Burma comes from colonial era, Myanmar comes from the military. Given the current situation and the people from the country being Burmese I'll use Burma.
