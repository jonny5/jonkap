The Taxi Driver

I held out all my remaining kyat[^1] bills in one hand. My taxi driver looked them over. This would amount to a generous tip, about the same as the ride itself. This was a combination of generosity and practicality. I had done this in the past, where If I had planned well enough I could leave with no cash and a happy taxi driver. Given the chaotic nature of driving in many of the world's cities it felt appropriate.

This driver was particularly deserving. Half way from the monastery to the airport, I realized I had not returned my room key. I asked the driver if he would be going to back to the monastery soon, and he was more than happy to help me out. Rather than be annoyed at my request, he smiled and seemed delighted.

So this large tip felt particularly well earned. He did not take the stack of bills, instead examining them and fanning them out in front of me. I was a little put off, not knowing what he was doing. It quickly became clear, he was assessing the amount and took what he felt was an appropriate tip. He portioned himself a reasonable tip, still leaving me with some bills. I gave one small attempt at having him take them all, not pushing it further when he made himself clear. 

His face lit up more when I had asked him for a favor (returning the key) than from getting the tip. 

The Young Monk

I had arrived in Mandalay without much of a plan. Luckily, I had made a friend on the trip and she knew of one of the prime things to do there – climb the steps of Mandalay Hill and see the sunset. It it is a nice, steady climb up many steps, through pagodas and ultimately to a beautiful view overlooking the whole city and river, with a pastel sunset. 

What turned out to be more meaningful was in the opposite direction, away from the view. We had happened to come to the top of the hill on a popular day for locals, largely there to practice other languages (including English). They were very kind about it, humble about their own limitations (even when they were quite good) and it allowed for more natural conversation. There were college students, younger and older folks too. Most notably, we were approached by several young monks and a large group of students they were teaching. Their enthusiasm was contagious, we took questions and tried our best to engage with them. The whole way down we talked with the monks. It was a sweet interaction, and also short and a bit overstimulating, between the crowds and the beautiful view.

The monk leading the group told us his story, that his name was Ashin Kosalla he had taken over a monastery that needed leadership. In the process, he started a language program for studnets in a classroom on the property. When he invited us to visit, we were enthuiastic about the prospect and were able to take him on the offer a few days later.

He was generously insistent on picking us up, and so he found us at our hostel (with his friend who drives, if a monk has taken all the precepts they do not drive) and brought us to the classroom. We talked a bit with the whole class, and then split off into two groups. The students practiced a bit of their english asking us questions and I did my best to answer clearly. It ended up being a bit more like an interview, and I felt kind of like a celebrity. A memorable question was about my favorite music. I started listing off some artists and each time a familiar name came up, the students would audibly show approval and smile. Culture being able to span the globe and create a small connection over something small like this felt very beautfiul. The enthusiasm was contagious. I tried my best to get all of them to share – some were more capable and willing than others. The session was also a source of self reflection, how seemingly mundane parts of my life can be intriguing to others (and the same in the opposite direction).

After the class, Ashin gave us a tour of the monastery and explained how he had taken on this role of managing it. He was quite young and it seemed like a lot of responsibility. He had clearly dedicated himself to service and to helping these students. I know I would have a lot of fear of the undertaking. He treated us to food and tea and was a very gracious host. Much like my taxi driver, he was helping me to feel more connected during my trip, and was treating it like we were doing him the favor.

He kept me updated that he was still teaching years later, providing students with a valuable outlet even amidst the political strife in Burma.

The Banh Mi

On the bus to Yangon (see Seat #12) I stuck out pretty clearly as a non Burmese rider.  The bus ride was a long journey, so midway through the journey there was a stop at an outdoor place with food. I hadn't known this would be an option, so prepared myself well enough with snacks.

A young woman named Sane waved me over to a table with her and her friends. She spoke good English, and ordered me something vegetarian on the menu, which would not have been possible on my own. When we disembarked in Yangon, she offered to hold my seatmate's newborn as she gathered her belongings. When we finally arrived in Yangon, she helped me navigate the chaos, giving me the options of how to get to my hotel. I settled on a taxi and she communicated with the driver for me.

I was mostly intending on just resting in Yangon, this was a bit of a transition. I had spent 2 months traveling and would end my trip at a monastery after this. Sane offered to show me around a bit one day, so we met in the central area and took transit to a shopping mall. We walked around and she was insistent as the guide and city host that she would get me something.  I felt that I should treat her instead, but I didn't argue. I settled on a drink and she got herself a banh mi. She had really hyped up this banh mi, saying it was her favorite spot for food in the area. We walked out of the mall and found nice place to sit looking out at the water. We had a nice conversation, as she ate her banh mi and I sipped my drink. 

A young boy came by, asking for food. Without a moment of hesitation, she gave him half her sandwich. There didn't appear to be any thought, the decision came naturally to her. When we got up to walk around some more, the boy had left the ends of the sandwich and the wrapper on the ground, not throwing it away. She picked up the littered wrapper and crumbs and threw it out without any reactivity, no feeling of ungratefulness or negativity toward the kid. The whole process seemed totally organic to her being.

Generosity is a core teaching of the Buddha, considered one of the 7 perfections (paramis). Nowhere in my months of traveling did I feel it's presence more vividly than in Burma and in these actions.

I had a 1 month tourist visa[^2] for Burma. I knew I wanted to spend time at a monastery, I just wasn't sure how to split the month. So I ended up splitting my time evently, which I am very grateful for – my time spent throughout the country was as meaningful as the time practicing.

Core to all of these interactions was that generosity seemed to flow naturally: from the taxi driver, Ashin, and Sane. This is often not the case as a tourist. I don't begrudge anyone for seeing me as a walking dollar sign, as that is part of the nature of being a tourist. It did make the contrast even more refreshing and heart warming. This was further amplified by encountering this generosity at the end of my trip, after months of traveling.

Generosity can be both a trait and a practice. Both actual physical acts and the mental state and intentions (and the mental state associated) are emphasized. My teacher Gil Fronsdal suggests a practice of carrying around a bill (10,20,50 whatever feels appropriate) with the intention of giving it away. Even if you never part with it, it's a deliberate way of inclining the mind toward being generous. This is a way to see how generosity can be both things, and if generosity comes as a trait then the practice can flow more naturally. 

Living a life that is dedicated to generosity and in service of others can be challenging. At times I feel able to embody it, and it is energizing and connecting. Other times, I get caught up in my own life and the world feels much smaller. Three distinct images from these anecdotes live on in my mind: my hand holding out cash, the classroom of excited students, and the scraps of a donated banh mi littered on the ground. They help me remember that everyone (including myself) are a lot more capable of being a positive force in the world than sometimes seems possible.
